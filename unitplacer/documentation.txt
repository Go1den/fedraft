For each map, all present characters consume one row of memory.

For example, Lyn on the prologue map is stored at addresses 0xCC5B50-0xCC5B5F.

In order to make sure the draft characters are placed properly, it is important
to understand how this data is stored per map, so that we can swap it out in all places.

For example, if Kent is 1st pick in the draft, Kent's data will need to be swapped in
wherever Lyn's data is present. Likewise, Kent's base game presence will need to be removed,
or replaced with another drafted character.

Here is the documentation for what each byte does in a row:

00: The unit's ID
01: The unit's class ID
02: If this unit is a commander, the commander's ID (AI only). Otherwise set to 0x00. (likely should not change)
03: The unit's state (See UnitStateEnum) (likely should not change)
04: pre-placement X coordinate (likely should not change)
05: pre-placement Y coordinate (likely should not change)
06: post-placement X coordinate (likely should not change)
07: post-placement Y coordinate (likely should not change)
08: Held item 1
09: Held item 2
0A: Held item 3
0B: Held item 4
0C: Primary AI behavior ID (set to 0x00 for player characters)
0D: Secondary AI behavior ID (set to 0x00 for player characters)
0E: Target AI behavior ID (set to 0x00 for player characters)
0F: Retreat AI behavior ID (set to 0x00 for player characters)
